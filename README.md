Different ways to display data

### Version
0.1.0

## Prerequisite

Make sure you have installed Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.

## How to set up test environment

- Download the (source) zip file to local system and Extract it.
- Go to **data-analysis** folder via cmd.
- Do **npm install** to install the dependencies.

  	```bash
  		$ npm install
  	```

Your application should be running on port 9000, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
